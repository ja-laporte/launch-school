README

I've created this Launch School Repo so that I could practice all the exercises, and code along with the examples in each chapter.

I've separated the chapters by folder, and the exercises by sub-folders in each chapter. (except for the variables chapter, as I didn't yet know how I was going to structure the lessons & exercises.)

Additionally, I've used the repo to practice git and git hub, by completing some lessons and/or exercises, then adding them to git, and finally pushing each change to gihub. The goal is to get comfortable with providing daily commits, regardless of how small, so I can 'get the reps in'.
